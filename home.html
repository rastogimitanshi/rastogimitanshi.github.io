    I am a Final year B.Tech CS Undergraduate from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University aka IGDTUW. I love singing and reading fictions. Apart from being curious about new technology and generally about how stuff works, I have a knack for problem solving. I have a positive outlook towards life and believe that we can actually make this world a better place. I'll be joining InfoEdge soon as a Software Developer to explore my developer skills.<br>
    I love K-Pop (BTS to be specific). I know how to read/write Korean (Annyeonghaseyo!). I plan on learning more languages(Programming too).
    I am actually an introvert diguised as an extrovert trying to fit into this world, although, if you want to talk or discuss about anything, feel free to reach out to me. Check out the <a href="#contact"> contact </a> section for that!
